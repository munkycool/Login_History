# Login_History
This prints the login history of all users in a Linux enviorment 

# What it does 

This project lists the login history of a user and then prints the results in the ~/Documents folder. If the user does not have a ~/Documents folder this BASH script will create it. It also doesn't overwrite the file, so the previus results from every time that the script has been run are saved in the same file. 

## The use case 

This is usefull to track logins over a long period of time and save the output in a single file.
